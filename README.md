## About the integration

The **Medusa TaxJar Integration** connects [Medusa](https://www.medusajs.com/) with [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/), enabling seamless automation of tax calculations for products and shipping. By leveraging this integration, you can save time and eliminate manual tax handling, allowing you to focus on your core e-commerce operations.

**Key features include:**

- **Automated tax calculations** tailored for diverse product categories.
- **Product tax code management** to ensure tax accuracy.
- **Real-time updates** to stay compliant with tax laws.

## Integration Overview

### Step 1: Set up your TaxJar account

1. Create an account on [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/).
2. Obtain your **API key** and configure your business details, including nexus information.

### Step 2: Extend Medusa's ProductCategory Model

Enhance the ProductCategory model to include a `tax_code` property. This allows TaxJar to calculate taxes based on product categories. Follow the detailed implementation steps outlined in the [documentation](#).

### Step 3: Sync Tax Codes

Utilize the TaxJar API to fetch and seed tax codes into your database. A sample script is provided in the guide for easy seeding. -> [See the guide here ->](https://rigbyjs.com/blog/medusa-taxjar)

### Step 4: Implement a Custom Tax Provider

Replace Medusa's default tax provider with a custom TaxJar provider. This step ensures that your transactions leverage TaxJar's powerful tax calculation engine.

### Step 5: Admin Configuration

Add a user-friendly widget in the Medusa admin panel to assign tax codes to product categories.

### Wrapping Up

By completing these steps, your Medusa store will have automated tax calculations, making tax compliance and management effortless.
